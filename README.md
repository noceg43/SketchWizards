# Sketch Wizards

Welcome to **Sketch Wizards**, an engaging drawing game developed for the LG Web OS Hackathon 2024! 🎨✨

**[Hackathon Details](https://weboshackathon.lge.com/)**

## Overview

**Sketch Wizards** is a fun and interactive drawing game for up to **8 players**. Using a Magic Remote, players draw on an LG TV screen while an advanced machine learning model attempts to interpret and guess the sketches. 🖌️🤖 The game features customizable player names, adjustable time limits, and multiple rounds. After each round, leaderboards display scores and rankings, fostering a competitive atmosphere. 

## Key Features

## Project Goals

The project is designed to **minimize package dependencies** to ensure maximum compatibility with the Web OS platform. 📦🚫

## Machine Learning Integration
